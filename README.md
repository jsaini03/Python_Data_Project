### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analyst

Next I narrowed the analysis and focused on DA roles and looked for both highest paid skills and most in-demand skills. Used 2 bar charts to showcase the comparison.

### Visualize Data
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(2,1)

# Top 10 highest paid skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, hue='median', palette='dark:g_r', ax=ax[0])
ax[0].legend().remove()
ax[0].set_title('Highest Paid Skills for DA in US')
ax[0].set_ylabel('')
ax[0].set_xlabel('')
ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, y: f'${int(x/1000)}k'))

# Top 10 most in-demand skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_top_skills.index, hue='median', palette='light:g', ax=ax[1])
ax[1].legend().remove()
ax[1].set_title('Most In-Demand Skills for DA in US')
ax[1].set_ylabel('')
ax[1].set_xlabel('Median Salary (USD)')
ax[1].set_xlim(ax[0].get_xlim())
ax[1].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, y: f'${int(x/1000)}k'))

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))
# Add labels to points and collect them in a list
texts = []
for i, txt in enumerate(df_DA_skills.index):
    texts.append(plt.text(df_DA_skills['skill_percent'].iloc[i], df_DA_skills['median_salary'].iloc[i], " " + txt))

# Adjust text to avoid overlap and add arrows
adjust_text(texts, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='gray'))
